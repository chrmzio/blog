            <h1 id="i-wrote-my-own-static-site-builder-in-go">I wrote my own static site builder in Go</h1>

<p><strong>I know, another one!</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to start learning <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Go</a>, and I wished for a <em>stupid simple</em> static site builder that I‚Äôd understand inside out ‚Äî
so I wouldn‚Äôt spend hours digging through docs like I used to with <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://www.getzola.org" target="_blank">Zola</a>.
Both are great tools, but they‚Äôre already full-grown, feature-rich beasts.</p>

<p>Being a <strong>*covid-born software dev</strong>, I‚Äôve always cared more about <strong>themes</strong> first.
My usual workflow looked something like this: find a theme I like (usually the most complicated one), tweak it endlessly, never write a single post, delete everything, and start again ‚Äî either with another theme or a different tool.</p>

<p>Not this time. No, no, no.
This time I‚Äôm building my own tool ‚Äî one I fully understand ‚Äî and I‚Äôm finally going to start writing articles.</p>

<p>*<em>A transparent editor and preferably live-wallpaper-demanding coder.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-pure-static-site-builder-based-on-my-workflow">A pure static site builder based on my workflow</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I had in mind for the first version:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>md</code> ‚Üí <code>html</code></p></li>

<li><p>pure static sites</p></li>

<li><p>no (I repeat, <strong>no</strong>) JavaScript</p></li>

<li><p>configurable themes</p></li>

<li><p>a decent CLI with:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>blog init</code>, <code>post new</code>, <code>page new</code>, <code>build</code>, and <code>serve</code> commands to start with</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>a slightly opinionated design (not too many options)</p></li>

<li><p>mobile-first approach</p></li>

<li><p>a very basic feature set:</p>

<ul>
<li>tag-based structure and search</li>
<li>related/next post based on tags</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>easy configuration ‚Äî no more than 10 variables, please</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That‚Äôs supposed to be the starter pack. I‚Äôll keep adding features gradually, but carefully.</p>

<h3 id="written-in-go">Written in Go</h3>

<p>The first language I ever learned was Java. My bootcamp was mostly Java, with a bit of C#.
I still like it ‚Äî and my first CLI app attempt was a little <a href="https://github.com/chrmzio/nof" target="_blank">Spring Shell project</a>.
Development itself was fine, but building binaries and distributing them was a pain.
Plus, Spring Shell is more suitable for long-running, REPL-style apps.</p>

<p>At that time, I was just figuring out which language I wanted to use for building CLI tools.
So I moved on and started looking into <a href="https://rust-lang.org" target="_blank">Rust</a>.
I wrote a small CLI tool in Rust that connects to local or remote AI and works nicely with Helix ‚Äî it takes selected text and fixes typos and grammar.
But I‚Äôm kind of AI-allergic these days. Feels like LLMs steal some of the joy from software development, but that‚Äôs a <a href="llms-suck-the-fun-out-of-coding.html" target="_blank">story</a> for another day.</p>

<p>I enjoyed Rust‚Äôs syntax and speed, but man ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tough language.
At least for me, at this stage.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">Go</a> was the next choice. And maaaan, what a pleasant language!
It builds insanely fast. I literally rebuild the project every time I notice something to fix while writing this article ‚Äî and I build the blog alongside it.
It doesn‚Äôt slow me down <em>at all</em>. Such a nice experience.</p>

<p>This site builder is actually my <strong>second project in Go</strong>.
The first one was a git-based forum CLI app using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea" target="_blank">Bubble Tea</a>.
It‚Äôs a fun project ‚Äî it taught me a few git tricks I had no idea existed.
Basically, I use git and a bare repo as the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù and Bubble TUI as the ‚Äúfrontend,‚Äù to give it a forum-like feel.
It‚Äôs still a work in progress, but I plan to finish it ‚Äî I like the concept.</p>

<p>So, dear beautiful people of the internet, let me introduce my little static site builder ‚Äî <strong>bib</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="bib-the-builder">Bib the builder</h3>

<p>Don‚Äôt ask me where the name came from originally.
Let‚Äôs just say it now stands for <strong>‚Äúblog I built‚Äù</strong>, okay?</p>

<p>I‚Äôll share the repo link once I clean it up a bit and finish the main refactor.
Right now, Bib‚Äôs code is in that <em>‚Äúlet‚Äôs just add this and move it into a separate file later‚Äù</em> stage.</p>

<p>And as I‚Äôm writing this post, <strong>bib</strong> is already capable of:</p>

<pre><code>‚ùØ bib
bib - Personal Blog Management Tool

</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned above, more to come, but not that much more üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

<p>And that is it for now.</p>
